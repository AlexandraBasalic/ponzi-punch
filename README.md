# 🦝 AUDITOR RADAR  
*"Because nobody audits the auditors."*  


⚠️ **WARNING: THIS TOOL IS INTENTIONALLY UGLY**  
- No animations → Fraud isn’t entertaining  
- No "user-friendly" fluff → SEC filings aren’t either  
- Just **raw, angry truth** → Like your last audit report

## 🔍 Why This Exists

Auditors are supposed to protect investors. But when:

- The same firms keep approving "creative accounting"
- Small audit shops rubber-stamp billion-dollar companies
- Nobody tracks who keeps failing inspections

...you need tools that **follow the paper trail**.

### What This Does
1. Checks if an auditor has **PCAOB violations**
2. Flags **high-risk patterns** (like frequent auditor switches)
3. Shows **public evidence** (no opinions, just SEC filings)
